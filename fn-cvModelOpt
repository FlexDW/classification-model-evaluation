cvModelOpt <- function(x, y, weight, cvSet, nlambda=500){
# Assumes that variable selection has already been
# performed and optimizes both likelihood weights and 
# L2 penalty for AUC. Optimal selected as ave AUC minus one sd.
# Returns: A list with optimal L2 and weight as well as
#     the average AUC and the standard deviation across sets.
# Args:
# - X:  the regressor matrix (as passed to glmnet)
# - y:  the binary response vector. Must be 0 or 1 for the weights
# - weight: the weighting for positive cases (i.e. y == 1) from 0 to 1.
# - cvSet: cross validation fold index, passed to foldid in cv.glmnet.
#     mandatory for comparable results across different models.
# - nlambda: number of lambda parameters glmnet searches. A larger
#     value means a more granular search but takes longer.

  # apply weight to positive cases and smooth with sqrt
  w = abs(weight - y)^0.5
